# Movie Recommender System

Recommendation systems play one of the most dominant roles behind the success of many applications that targets users. Some of these most commonly recognized examples of applications using recommender systems as playlist generators for video and music services are like Netflix, YouTube and Spotify, services for product recommenders such as Amazon, for social media platforms for content recommenders such as Facebook and Twitter. A recommendation engine channels the information utilizing various calculations and prescribes the most applicable items to users. It first captures the past history or behavior of a user and based on that, recommends items they may like. But what in case a completely new user visits a site, there will be no past history of that user. In such scenarios, one potential solution could be to suggest the movies with high popularity.

Three main approaches have been used for movie recommender systems.
- The first is the Demographic Filtering i.e offering generalized recommendations to every user, based on movie popularity, score and/or genre. The engine recommends the same movies to users with similar demographic features. This approach is considered to be too simple as it is too impersonal.

- Second, is content-based filtering, where the user data was utilised and gathered such as movies watched/searched, and prescribe other similar movies.

- The last one focused on is collaborative filtering, where groups of similar users were made and used information about the group to make recommendations to the user.
